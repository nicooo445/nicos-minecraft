            <h2>
                why minecraft is good
            </h2>
            <p>
                minecraft is good because it is a game where kids can freely use their imagination to build and invent things and use their imagination to create cool buildings.
            </p>
            <p>
                another reason why its so good is because unlike other games that are violent and about killing, minecraft allows kids to have peaceful experiences building whatever their imagination allows them to.
